                <p>This is not my best performance, because I'm much better at UI/UX Design now than when I made this website. I'm keeping it here for documentation and see the progression that I've made since then.</p>

                <p>This website wasn't that challenging to be honest, I finished it in around 2 or 3 days. But, I did got a little problem when I was about to take a picture of myself in a studio, the first studio that I was trying to reach out to was very busy, and was not very clear about it, so I got pretty annoyed.</p>
                <p>After I got my pictures taken, I began editing it, which is probably the hardest part of the whole website development process.</p>

                <p>And for the photo editing, I used an app called <strong>Affinity Designer</strong>, what I like about this app is that it has a smart masking tool that allows you to cut out any complex shapes like a person or animal with ease, although it's not perfect all the time.</p>

                <p>I like the result, I think the design looks really good, but it's pretty weird that if I just visualize my design without actually looking at it directly, it feels like the design is boring. Maybe that's a sign that the design that I have on this website isn't the best, especially the working process's icons, I think they don't look consistent with the rest of the website. but over all, it's not a bad design</p>

                <p>23 IT was my first <strong>Webflow</strong> project in my freelancing journey and was my first ever project that came from a real client. But, unfortunately, the client no longer needed the website, so I have it as a portfolio, and I'm proud of the design that I'd made</p>

                <p>The biggest hurdle that I had when making this website was the complex filter for the job posts page and CMS based testimonials. it took me over a week to finish these tasks</p>
                <p>I know that there's a lot of plugins for <strong>Webflow</strong> that I can use to finish these tasks easier and faster, but my mindset was to make my client not paying extra for those paid plugins and I didn't use the free ones such as <strong>Finsweet's</strong> plugins because it was complicated, and I couldn't get it working. I soon realized that I should've asked my client whether if htey're willing to pay for those plugins or not.</p>
